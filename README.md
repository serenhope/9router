A fork of [Decolua/9router](https://github.com/Decolua/9router) with extra features for everyone who wants them.

One gateway, one API key, any model: an OpenAI-compatible endpoint that routes to Claude, GPT, Gemini, Kimi, Qwen, GLM, DeepSeek, Grok and many more, with OAuth or your own accounts. This is still that router, with the parts I use daily changed and the rough edges fixed, free for anyone to use.

## What it routes

The gateway accepts a request in OpenAI, Claude or Gemini shape, translates it to whatever the target provider speaks, and streams the answer back. Providers are grouped by how you sign in:

| Sign-in | Providers |
| --- | --- |
| OAuth | Claude, OpenAI Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity, Kiro, Kimi (Moonshot), Grok CLI, xAI, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, GitLab, Windsurf, Trae, Zed, iFlow, Qoder, Cline, KiloCode, CodeBuddy, Xiaomi MIMO |
| API key | OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, GLM (Z.ai / Zhipu), MiniMax, Mistral, Perplexity, Groq, Together, Fireworks, Cerebras, SambaNova, SiliconFlow, Nebius, Hugging Face, Venice, Voyage and dozens more |
| Free tier | OpenRouter, OpenCode, Kiro, Gemini, Cloudflare AI, NVIDIA, Morph, Poolside, Kimchi, LLM7, api-airforce |
| Web cookie | DeepSeek Web, Gemini Web, Kimi Web |
| Local | Ollama, LM Studio style self-hosted nodes, self-hosted TTS/STT/embeddings |

It is not only chat. The same gateway also serves text to image, image to text, video generation, text to speech, speech to text, embeddings, web search and web fetch, each with its own `/v1`-style endpoint.

## What this fork adds

Everything lives alongside upstream's features. The short version:

- **Per-key control** - every key carries its own token limit, reset interval, expiry and model allow-list, enforced on every endpoint.
- **Custom models & plugins** - models that answer under your own name (the real target never leaks), per-model plugin badges, a model playground and comparisons.
- **Operability** - scheduled backups to Telegram or GitHub, proxy pools, a security log of who signed in and from where, a theme that applies to the whole site, and an in-dashboard update banner.

The [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) is the source of truth: it is regenerated on every release, so it always lists what is actually new. Anything not written here yet may already ship in your build - check the changelog rather than this file.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/serenhope/9router.git
cd 9router
npm install
npm run dev          # dashboard on http://localhost:20127
```

Production:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

Docker:

```bash
docker build -t 9router-fork .
docker run -d -p 20128:20128 -v 9router-data:/app/data 9router-fork
```

Once it is running:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Dashboard | `http://localhost:20127/dashboard` (first login: `seren123`, or set `INITIAL_PASSWORD`) |
| OpenAI-compatible | `http://localhost:20127/v1` |
| Claude-compatible | `http://localhost:20127/v1/messages` |
| Gemini-native | `http://localhost:20127/v1beta/models/{model}:generateContent` |
| Health probe | `GET /api/health` |

Point any CLI tool or agent at the base URL, generate a key under **Endpoint & Key**, and you are done.

## Model names you can call

| Form | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Provider model | `kiro/claude-sonnet-4.5`, `kimi/kimi-k2.6`, `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-pro` |
| Custom node | `mynode/gpt-oss-120b` |
| Combo | `my-combo` (fallback, round-robin, fusion and more) |
| Custom model | any name you define in Custom Models |

## Configuration

The app reads a few environment variables with sensible defaults; see [.env.example](./.env.example). State lives in `~/.9router` (SQLite database, backups, secrets).
